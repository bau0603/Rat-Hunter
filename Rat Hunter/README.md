# Rat Hunter

Description: 
You are an animal control officer in charge of preventing rats from infesting streets
and homes. Armed with a tranquilizer and net gun, your job is to tranquilize then capture
rodents. From the countryside to the busy streets of the city, stop the rats from escaping and
invading the area. 

Current Objectives:
Aim and alternate shooting between a tranquilizer and a net gun with the left and right
mouse clicks respectively. 
Rats will run around from left to right and vice versa to evade
captures. 
Other objects will be placed in the game to trick players, and if a player hits it, they
lose points. 
The level ends when all rats are captured, the player hits too many objects, or the time
runs out.
